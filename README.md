Byron Pulsifer once said: ‚ÄúTo adapt is to move ahead.‚Äù As Brazilian that has left my roots and reside in Ireland for the past 5 years I live by this motto.

More than 15 years of experience in the business industry has led me to be driven, focused, business oriented and data driven. Communicating with a multinational client, producing daily reports, analysing data, negotiating debts and helping the company I worked for expand more than 15% its growth in a month and 100% in a year are some of my accomplisments.

Whether it is working on group project in College leading a team of 4 people, talking to an audience in church of 500 or being on TV/Radio due to my journalism course I take pride in communicating in the most effective way and engaging with my audience.

I make it my mission to have goals and set the targets to get where I want to be. Challenges do not discourage me. I love overcoming difficult situations and it is even more gratifying when I can bring other felow colleagues along with me on the journey. Teamwork is essential in my conception if you want to get farther quicker.

Enjoying myself is extremely important to me too, when I am not working or studying, you can find me out exploring the world with my fiancee, working out.

Please reach out to me if you want to talk about data, customer experience or techonology.

Skills: HTML / CSS / JS / NODE / BOOTSTRAP5 / UI / VANILLA JS / SQL / WORD / EXCEL / POWERPOINT / OUTLOOK / WINDOWS 10
